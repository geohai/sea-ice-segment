# Getting started
### Using a terminal
Clone this repository to your local machine using your tool of choice. Open the [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) (requires a working [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installation):

Then, use the prompt to **navigate to the location of the cloned repository**. Install the [environment](environment.yml) using the command:  
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Follow the instructions to activate the new environment:  
`conda activate rs-fusion`
